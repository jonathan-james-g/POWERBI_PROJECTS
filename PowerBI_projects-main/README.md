## Problem Statement

The existing problem statement underscores the requirement for a dynamic and interactive Human Resources Dashboard powered by Power BI. The primary objective of this dashboard is to visualize crucial workforce-related information within an enterprise. This encompasses a comprehensive view of various worker attributes, including gender distribution, job functions, educational level, geographic distribution, and employment modalities. Additionally, the dashboard is designed to facilitate granular filtering based on specific departments, enabling targeted analysis and insights.
The envisioned Human Resources Dashboard in Power BI aims to provide a holistic view of the workforce composition and distribution, empowering stakeholders to gain actionable insights into the organization's human capital. By leveraging interactive visualizations and data filtering capabilities, the dashboard seeks to offer a seamless and intuitive user experience, allowing for in-depth exploration of workforce demographics, roles, and regional distribution.
Furthermore, the dynamic nature of the dashboard will enable users to drill down into specific departments, gaining detailed insights into the composition and characteristics of each functional area.
